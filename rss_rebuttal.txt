We would like to thank all reviewers for their constructive and critical 
remarks. We will address all wording and grammar issues as well the difficulties
with comprehending of formulae. In the continuation of this document we are going 
to clarify all misunderstood or wrongly interpreted parts of the paper.
First off we would like to stress that the main novel contribution of the submitted paper 
is in the theoretical consideration and design of the new feature and not 
so much in getting the industrial, bullet-proof recognition system working.
The latter issue is, as clearly stated in the paper, on our future research agenda.
To "3x3x3 grid" - will be fixed. "Handling of binarized colors" - we provide the 
reference #12. "Dimensions 12 and 21 following Eq 3" - [Asako]. "On GRSD being
terse desribed" - we will provide modified GRSD implementation as an algorithm.
"On classification of partially visible objects" - this claim is supported
by reference #12. "On Kinect's noise" an analysis is available here: 
http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni_kinect/kinect_accuracy (note: not authors' site).
"On training from views similar to that obtained by real robot" - this but obvious
that the training and the testing data should be similar. "On results in Table II" -
Of especial interest are columns 4-7 which present classification results for ConVOSCH
and VOSCH for test data with different noise levels and compare them to GRSD and 
ColorCHLAC (columns 1-4). Take-home message is that the former outperform the latter.
"On slightly less convincing VOSCH results" - we will remove this claim as Table IV 
gives actual factual results. "On how to describe shape and color" - the lack
of reliable Bag-Of-Experts system and the success of features for 2D data (e.g. SIFT)
and 3D data (e.g. FPFH) suggest that developing all-in-one is a clear way to go.
